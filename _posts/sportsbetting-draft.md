# Winning with Math: A Guide to Profitable Sports Betting

## Introduction
As a recent college graduate, I've noticed many of my peers getting into sports betting. This isn't surprising, given the bombardment of ads from companies like DraftKings and FanDuel. I'm a tennis player, and I also enjoy probabilistic (gambling) games like poker, so sports betting naturally intrigued me. How do DraftKings and FanDuel make money in the first place? How do people profit from sports betting? Why do some get banned?

In this post, I'll explain the underlying mechanics of sportsbooks and how to become an advantage player, turning the odds in your favor.

## The House Edge
You're likely aware of the fact that the "house always wins" when it comes to gambling -- but how do they get that edge? Simply put, when you place a wager, whether that be on roulette, slots, or sports, the casino pays out **less than what is mathematically fair** for a win. This is the so-called the "house edge".

__Let's look at a toy example:__
Imagine you're at a casino betting on a coin flip. Assuming you wager $10, and that the coin is fair (that is, a 50% chance of landing heads and a 50% chance of landing tails), what would be a fair payout?

The answer is $20, or more generally, double what you wagered. Why does this make sense? On average, you win just as often as you lose, so over many bets, your gains and losses should balance out leaving you with no net gain or loss. A fair payout ensures that, on average, you break even in the long run.

Mathematically, we say that if the **expected value (EV)** of a bet is zero, then the bet is **fair**:
$$EV = P(\text{Win}) * (\text{\$ Profit}) + P(\text{Lose}) * (\text{\$ Lost})$$
- The win probability $$P(\text{Win}) = 0.5$$
