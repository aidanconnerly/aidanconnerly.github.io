**Hey!** 

I'm a data scientist in the process of obtaining my master's degree at UC Berkeley. In undergrad, I studied physics and math at Bowdoin College where I fell in love with mathematical modeling and machine learning.

At the moment, I'm most interested in machine learning applications to physics, financial/betting markets and sports. 

When I'm not coding I'm probably playing tennis, soccer, or snowboarding. I also play poker, chess, and solve Rubik's cubes for fun. I'm always looking for ways to blend my hobbies and academic interests.

This website serves as a hub for sharing my projects and thoughts. Thanks for stopping by!
