I'm a recent graduate from Bowdoin College with degrees in physics and math! I'm broadly interested in mathematical modeling and am looking to gain more experience in statistical/machine learning.

Outside of academics, I love tennis, soccer, snowboarding, chess, Rubik's cubes, and poker. I'm always looking for ways to combine my hobbies and academic interests. This website serves as a hub for my academic and personal/fun projects!
