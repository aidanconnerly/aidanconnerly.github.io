**Hey!** 

I'm a machine learning engineer in the streaming space, currently pursuing my master's degree in Data Science at UC Berkeley. In undergrad, I studied physics and math at Bowdoin College where I fell in love with mathematical modeling and machine learning.

Outside of work, I love playing tennis, soccer, or snowboarding. I also dabble in poker, chess, and speedsolving Rubik's cubes. I'm always looking for ways to blend my hobbies and academic interests.

This website serves as a hub for sharing my projects and thoughts. Thanks for stopping by!
