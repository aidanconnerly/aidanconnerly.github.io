# About me
I'm a student at Bowdoin College studying physics and math! I'm broadly interested in mathematical modeling and am looking to gain more experience in statistical and machine learning.

Outside of academics, my hobbies include tennis, soccer, snowboarding, chess, Rubik's cubes, and poker. I'm always looking for ways to combine my hobbies and academic interests. This website serves as a hub for my academic and personal/fun projects!
