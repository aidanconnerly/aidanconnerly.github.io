**Hey!** I'm a data science master's student at UC Berkeley. In undergrad, I studied physics and math at Bowdoin College where I fell in love with mathematical modeling and machine learning.

When I'm not coding I'm probably playing tennis, soccer, or snowboarding. I also play poker, chess, and solve Rubik's cubes for fun. I'm always looking for ways to blend my hobbies and academic interests.

This website serves as a hub for sharing my projects and fun side quests. Thanks for stopping by!
